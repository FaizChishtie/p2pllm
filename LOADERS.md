# Loader Parsers for p2pllm

This document provides guidelines on how to create and submit loader parsers for the p2pllm project. Loader parsers are Python scripts that read and interpret binary files containing model weights and convert them into TorchScript format for use with p2pllm.

## Creating a Loader Parser

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `my_loader.py`) in the `/loaders` folder.

2. Import the required Python modules, such as `torch`, `torch.nn`, and any other necessary libraries.

3. Define the PyTorch model architecture that corresponds to the binary file you want to load.

4. Implement a function to read the binary file and load the weights into the PyTorch model. This function should take a file path as input and return the model with the loaded weights.

5. Implement the main function to convert the binary file to a TorchScript model:
   - Read command-line arguments to get the input binary file path and output TorchScript file path.
   - Create an instance of the PyTorch model.
   - Call the function from step 4 to load the weights into the model.
   - Convert the model to TorchScript format using `torch.jit.script()`.
   - Save the TorchScript model to a file using `torch.jit.save()`.

6. Test your loader parser with some sample binary files to ensure it works correctly.

## Submitting a Loader Parser

1. Fork the p2pllm project on GitHub.

2. Add your loader parser (e.g., `my_loader.py`) to the `/loaders` folder in your forked repository.

3. Update the `loaders.md` file in your forked repository to include a brief description of your loader parser, the binary file format it supports, and any additional information that users may find helpful.

4. Create a pull request to submit your loader parser to the main p2pllm repository.

Please ensure that your loader parser follows the guidelines mentioned above and is compatible with the p2pllm project structure.
